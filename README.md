#Fisher Information for Partially Observable Simple Birth Processes

This repository contains the code to test computation of Fisher information for paritally observable simple birth processes. The code is predominatnly Maple and shell scripts. The c++ implementation being testsed is stored in a different repository, linked into the c++/ folder.

These are the files used to create our data for the paper of the same name (“Fisher Information for Partially Observable Simple Birth Processes”). It is as yet unpublished and is still being written.
